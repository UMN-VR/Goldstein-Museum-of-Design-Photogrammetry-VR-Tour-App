## Overview
The aim of this project is to create a virtual museum inspired on a real life one. Using the same artifacts but on you and improved virtual environment. This will give the U a global reach and cement the university's position as a pioneer in virtual reality. 

#### Hardware:
At the present moment only quest 2 native SDK app builds are being provided since the project is just at the proof of concept stage. Eventually the idea is to release a WebGL and host it on a domain so that everyone can access it regardless of platform. 


#### Software:
The proof of concept project was created using Unity and it is likely that the same workflows and platforms will be used to eat the final product, we will just tweaking the specifics of it to improve the final result.

To open up the project all you need to do is have a current installation of:

* Unity v2021.1.3.1f1

If you want to edit 3d Models:

* Blender (Any version will work really, would recomend using latest avaliable.)

If you want to scan your own 3d Models 

* Polycam (IOs App works better, would recomend using latest avaliable.)

##### Software Checkout and Setup:

You should create a copy of this repository structured as follows
